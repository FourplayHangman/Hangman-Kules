## Offical UMD Hangman
A simple hangman game that runs in the command line.
Figure out a UMD word by guessing
letters. If you guess a letter that's not in the
UMD word and you've already guessed it, you get
a penalty.
The game ends when you guess all letters
correctly or when the hangman is finished.

It has 5+ UMD words to guess from in English 

To play, simply run hangman.py with Python 3.6

Tested on Linux only.
